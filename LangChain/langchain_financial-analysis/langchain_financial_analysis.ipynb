The total deficit/surplus for the year increased significantly from 350,734 in 2021 to 600,100 in 2022. This indicates that the company\\'s operations have become more profitable or efficient, leading to a higher surplus of cash from operating activities.\\n\\n2. Depreciation and amortization slightly increased from 12,896 in 2021 to 14,093 in 2022. This could be due to the company acquiring more depreciable assets or the existing assets getting older.\\n\\n3. The company experienced a significant decrease in investment revenue presented as investing activities, from 6,226 in 2021 to 2,426 in 2022. This could suggest that the company\\'s investments did not perform as well in 2022 as they did in 2021.\\n\\n4. There was a significant shift in unrealized gains/losses on revaluation of long-term borrowings. In 2021, there was a gain of 8,075, but in 2022, there was a loss of 46,327. This could indicate a negative trend in the company\\'s long-term borrowings.\\n\\n5. The company\\'s receivables – current increased significantly from 531 in 2021 to 273,787 in 2022. This could suggest that the company sold more goods or services on credit in 2022, which could potentially lead to higher future cash inflows if these receivables are collected.\\n\\n6. There was a significant increase in prepayments and deposits from 9,167 in 2021 to 87,945 in 2022. This could indicate that the company made more advance payments for expenses or assets in 2022.\\n\\n7. The company\\'s accounts payable decreased from 68,508 in 2021 to 45,474 in 2022. This could suggest that the company paid off some of its short-term debts or had fewer purchases on credit in 2022.\\n\\nThese trends provide insights into the company\\'s cash flow activities and can be used to assess its financial health and performance. However, a more comprehensive analysis would also consider other factors such as the company\\'s income statement and balance sheet, as well as industry trends and economic conditions.'}\n"
